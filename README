So this uses somes examples from gtk+ and from telepathy-glib

Once again, nothing fancy, build this over a couple of hours.

I'm pretty sure it ain't following the standard of glib/gtk/or whatever else.

Did this to have a stream of status to have some fun with co-workers...

May improve it in the future... sometimes it seg fault... specially if you add/delete
statuses...


Got to love programming!!
